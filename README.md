# Cancer Prediction
In this project I have used an SVM model to predict the classes of cancer namely malignant and belign. For this, I have obtained a dataset containing medical details of patients and computed the probability for the classes of cancer by evaluating aspects like the shape and size of the tumor, number of clumps etc.
